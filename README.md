# ðŸŽ¯ GitHub-SE-Application-Nathanael
Taking this opportunity to introduce myself and showcase how I'd deliver client value with GitHub through strategic discovery, technical story telling and tailored solutions

Hello Shikha! I'm Nathanael, a Sales Engineer with a background in strategy and technical sales, applying for the GitHub Solutions Engineer role. I created this repo to go deeper than a resume - to demonstrate my intent, alignment and excitement for this opportunity at GitHub :).

## Why Me - At a Glance
Iâ€™m a technical seller with experience in IT & cloud infrastructure and automation â€” having supported clients across industries as they modernize their app delivery and observability stack.

At IBM, I lead demos and POCs for tools like Instana and Turbonomic, helping platform and DevOps teams optimize performance, reduce cloud waste, and streamline CI/CD workflows. Alongside that, I host internal sales enablement sessions and build custom prospecting cadences that improve conversion and client engagement.

I thrive in conversations where business goals meet technical complexity â€” and I specialize in translating product features into real-world outcomes for lean, high-impact teams and their leaders.

## What's in this Repo

- [GitHub Adoption SMB One-Pager](./docs/GitHub%20Adoption%20SMB.pdf)
A one-pager sharing some of my thoughts into GitHub's potential approach in the SMB market and the role SEs should play from my experience. SMBs and mid-market companies represent a massive growth. By positioning the platform as an accelerator of developer productivity and security - not just source control - SEs can play a crucial role in the pre-sales process and expanding GitHub's footprint across high-potential accounts.


- [GitHub Jiya Insights Deck](./docs/GitHub%20Jiya%20Insights.pptx.pdf)
A concise 3-slide playbook simulating how Iâ€™d engage a client using GitHub Free and Jenkins, mapping their gaps to GitHub Enterprise solutions. This would be identified as an expansion/ upsell opportunity.

##  Why GitHub?

Open source is changing the world. GitHub is the platform enabling that transformation by empowering devs to build, ship, and collaborate. Iâ€™m excited by the opportunity to work at a company thatâ€™s shaping the future of software collaboration. I am at a point in my career where I am prepared to fully embed myself in one purpose, one platform and one mission. I see GitHub being that for me. It exists to help developers build and deploy software that works in the real world. In a time where software drives everything â€” how we work, how we live, how businesses grow â€” being part of that space and growing in the space leaves room for much development and impact.
